## Aim
To develop a prompt-based application using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek for text assistance; Runway for video generation; and Midjourney for image generation) to demonstrate how prompt engineering can be applied to organize daily tasks, create multimedia content, and provide adaptive, intelligent assistance.

---

## AI Tools Required
- Text Assistance: ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek  
- Video Generation: Runway  
- Image Generation: Midjourney  

---

## Explanation
This experiment focuses on creating a prompt-based personal productivity assistant using multiple AI tools and large language models (LLMs).  

The assistant can:
- Manage and organize daily tasks  
- Schedule activities and set reminders using natural language  
- Provide personalized wellness tips  
- Generate multimedia outputs (images and videos) based on prompts  

The goal is to understand how prompt engineering enables LLMs and generative AI tools to collaborate and solve real-world productivity and creativity challenges.

## Prompt Used
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."

---

## Procedure
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.
